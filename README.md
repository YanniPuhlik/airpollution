Data:
332 files containing pollution monitoring data for fine particulate matter (PM) air pollution at **332 locations in the United States**. 
Each file contains data from a single monitor and the ID number for each monitor is contained in the file name.
Each file contains three variables:

 - **date:** the date of the observation in YYYY-MM-DD format (year-month-day)
 - **sulfate:** the level of sulfate PM in the air on that date (measured in 
   micrograms per cubic meter)
 - **nitrate:** the level of nitrate PM in the air on that date (measured in 
   micrograms per cubic meter)
